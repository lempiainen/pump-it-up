# Pump it up!
A workout tracker app designed for mobile first approach. The main motivation for this project is to test a development (and documentation) stack. Secondary reason is to provide the app I want to use when I'm hitting the gym :D

### Stack to be tested:
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the main framework
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) for styles
* [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for the component library (maybe)
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for e2e and component testing
* [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) for Server State management
* [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) for atomic Client State management
* [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for action-based Client State management (might not not be used)
* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for diagrams and wireframes
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for knowledge base)
